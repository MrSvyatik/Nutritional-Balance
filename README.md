### About
This is a Minecraft mod that enhances the food system to encourage you to eat a balanced diet.
Eating a variety of nutrients with the right balance will make you stronger and faster.
Ignoring your nutritional balance, however, can slow you down and weaken you.

This mod is easy to configure to your liking.
Nutrients are defined by item tags which can be customized with Data Packs
and further configured in the server-side configuration file.
All these customizations can be reloaded live, in-game.
Only raw ingredients need be tagged, since the mod will traverse through crafting ingredients
to discover a food's nutrients.
